    <h2>Why do I need to wait 5 seconds before getting redirected ?</h2>
    <p><b>hiber.link</b>, the original project of <i>OpenLink</i> (both projects were made by the same person) was suspended because it was too easy to redirect users to scam links without the user being able to do anything, I decided to add this confirmation page to reduce problem risk in the future. </p>
